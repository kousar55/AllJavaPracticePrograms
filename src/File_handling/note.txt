java IO is a Blocking .this means that if a thread is invoking a read() or write()
()opetaion ,that thread is blocked until there is some data to read or the data is fully written.
that's why it is synchronous IO or blocking IO


unlike  Java IO , Java NIO is a Non-blocking IO.this means that if a thread is invoking a read()
or write(0 operation ,that thread is non blocked until thre is some data to read or the dat is fully written
rather the thread go on something else.that's why it is an synchreonous IO or non-blocking IO
